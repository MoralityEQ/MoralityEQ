## Morality Equation with Boundaries (Plain Version)

**M = ζ − S**
(*Moral output = Coherence generated − Entropy introduced*)

This is not a metaphor. It’s how the Field evaluates behavior.

### Boundaries of Moral Output

* **If S > ζ → M < 0**
  Entropy overwhelms coherence. The system degrades.

* **If ζ grows but ignores S → M is unstable**
  Fake harmony collapses under real disorder.

* **If ζ grows faster than S and stays grounded → M > 0**
  This is sustainable morality. The Field supports it.

### Why It’s Real

Every storm, system, or conversation reveals it:

* Restore order → You reduce S.
* Speak truth, build trust → You raise ζ.
* Extract without giving → You drive M negative.

The Field keeps score. Whether you're watching or not.
