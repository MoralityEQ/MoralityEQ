# FAIR USE GUIDE FOR JURIES
## Spotting Creative Value vs. Content Theft

### YOUR ROLE AS A JURY

You are being asked to determine whether someone's use of copyrighted material was fair and legal, or whether it constituted theft. This is not about whether you personally like the content or agree with the message. Your job is to evaluate whether the defendant added genuine value or simply extracted value from someone else's work.

Current fair use law asks you to consider factors like "transformative use" and "market impact," but these terms can be confusing. This guide provides clearer questions to help you make this determination.

### THE CORE QUESTION

**Did the defendant create something genuinely new and valuable, or did they primarily copy existing work for their own benefit?**

Think of this like the difference between a music critic who analyzes a song versus someone who plays the entire song at their party and charges admission. The critic adds insight and commentary. The party host just uses someone else's work to make money.

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR: VALUE CREATION

**Signs the defendant added genuine value:**

**Original Analysis or Commentary**: Did they explain, critique, or teach something about the original work? A film reviewer showing clips while discussing cinematography techniques is adding educational value. A reaction streamer just saying "wow" and "that's crazy" while playing full videos is not.

**Creative Transformation**: Did they use the original work as raw material for something new? A parody that creates new jokes and insights about the original adds creative value. Simply copying content with minor changes does not.

**Educational Purpose**: Did they help their audience understand something better? A teacher showing excerpts from documentaries while explaining historical context serves educational purposes. Someone re-uploading entire documentaries with their logo does not.

**Cultural Commentary**: Did they use the original work to make a broader point about society, art, or current events? A comedian using news clips to highlight media bias creates cultural insight. Someone reposting news clips without comment does not.

### WHAT TO AVOID: VALUE EXTRACTION

**Signs the defendant primarily extracted value:**

**Minimal Addition**: Did they add very little to the original work? If someone shows long segments of copyrighted content with only brief comments, they are likely extracting rather than adding value.

**Audience Substitution**: Would people watch the defendant's content instead of the original? If viewers could get the same experience from the defendant's version without needing to see the original, this suggests value extraction.

**Commercial Benefit Without Contribution**: Did the defendant profit from someone else's work without adding substantial value? Making money from content is not wrong, but profiting primarily from copying rather than creating raises concerns.

**Market Harm**: Did the defendant's use reduce the market for the original work? If their version competes directly with the original and reduces sales or viewership, this suggests problematic extraction.

### PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

**Likely Fair Use (Value Creation):**
- A film studies professor showing movie scenes while teaching cinematography techniques
- A political commentator using news clips to analyze media coverage patterns  
- A music teacher playing song excerpts while explaining chord progressions
- A comedian creating parody versions that comment on the original work

**Likely Not Fair Use (Value Extraction):**
- Re-uploading entire movies with brief introductions
- Playing full music albums while providing minimal commentary
- Copying articles with only minor word changes
- Using copyrighted images in commercial products without permission

### THE AMOUNT QUESTION

**How much of the original work was used?**

Using small portions for specific analytical purposes generally supports fair use. Using large portions or entire works makes fair use much harder to justify, unless the use is clearly for parody, criticism, or educational analysis that requires extensive quotation.

Ask yourself: Was the amount used necessary for the defendant's stated purpose? A movie reviewer might need to show several scenes to demonstrate a pattern in filmmaking, but showing the entire movie would be excessive.

### THE MARKET IMPACT QUESTION

**Did this use harm the market for the original work?**

Consider whether the defendant's version serves as a substitute for the original. If people might watch the defendant's content instead of buying or viewing the original, this suggests market harm. If the defendant's content serves a different purpose or audience, market harm is less likely.

Educational uses in classroom settings, for example, typically do not harm commercial markets because they serve different purposes than entertainment consumption.

### MAKING YOUR DECISION

**After considering these factors, ask yourself:**

Did the defendant primarily add value through original analysis, commentary, education, or creative transformation? If yes, this supports a finding of fair use.

Did the defendant primarily extract value by copying substantial portions of original work without significant addition? If yes, this suggests the use was not fair.

Remember that perfect cases are rare. Most fair use determinations involve weighing competing factors. Your job is to determine which side of the scale carries more weight based on the evidence presented.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

**Intent Matters But Is Not Decisive**: Someone claiming educational purpose while actually seeking commercial gain should be viewed skeptically. However, commercial use does not automatically disqualify fair use if substantial value was added.

**Technical Quality Is Not the Standard**: The defendant does not need to be a professional critic or educator. The question is whether they added genuine insight, analysis, or creative transformation, regardless of production quality.

**Popular Opinion Is Not Relevant**: Whether the public likes or dislikes the defendant's content does not determine fair use. Focus on whether value was genuinely created rather than simply extracted.

### CONCLUSION

Fair use protects people who build upon existing works to create new value for society. It does not protect those who simply copy others' work for personal benefit. Your determination should reflect whether the defendant contributed to cultural conversation and knowledge or merely profited from someone else's creativity.

The law recognizes that all creative work builds upon what came before, but it requires that new contributions add genuine value rather than simply extracting it from existing sources.
